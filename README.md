# OPS4J Ramler

Thanks for looking into OPS4J Ramler, a code and documentation generator for the
RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML).

## Documentation

* [User Manual](http://ops4j.github.io/ramler/latest/)

## Contributing

In OPS4J, everyone is invited to contribute. We don't require any paperwork or community reputation.
All we ask you is to move carefully and to clean up after yourself: 

* Describe your problem or enhancement request before submitting a solution.
* Submit a JIRA issue before creating a pull request. This is required for the release notes.
* For discussions, the mailing list is more suitable than JIRA.
* Any bugfix or new feature must be covered by regression tests.
* Respect the coding style and formatting conventions of existing sources. There is an Eclipse
formatter in <https://github.com/ops4j/org.ops4j.pax.exam2/blob/master/assets/EclipseJavaFormatter.xml>.
 
## Build

You'll need a machine with Java 8+ and Apache Maven 3.3.1+ installed.

Checkout:

    git clone git://github.com/ops4j/org.ops4j.ramler.git
    cd org.ops4j.ramler

Run Build:

    mvn clean install

## Releases

Releases go to Maven Central.

## Issue Tracking

## Mailing List
